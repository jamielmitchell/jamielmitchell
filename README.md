## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University in the [Graduate School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/). I am in the [Brain Development and Education Lab](https://edneuro.stanford.edu/) where I study developmental cognitive neuroscience. I focus on understanding the neural correlates of reading and reading development in children with dyslexia.

Learn more about me at my personal website (coming soon).
